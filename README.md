# Bitwise-Workshop
Bitwise Workshop is a modular C program that showcases four fundamental bitwise operationsâ€”counting leading zeros, swapping endianness, rotating bits, and checking parity. Implemented entirely with bitwise operators, each feature resides in its own source file, offering a clear demonstration of core low-level techniques on 32-bit integers.
